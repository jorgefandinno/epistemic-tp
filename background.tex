\begin{definition}[G94-reduct]
    \label{eq:G94-reduct}
    The \emph{G94-reduct} of a theory~$\Gamma$ 
    with respect to an epistemic interpretation~$\wv$, written~$\Gamma^\wv$, is obtained by replacing each maximal subformula~$\fF$ of the forms $\K \fG$ and $\M \fG$ by $\top$, if $\wv \models \fF$; or by $\bot$, otherwise.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[G94-world view]
    \label{def:G94-world.view}
    An epistemic interpretation~$\wv$ is called a \emph{G94-world view} of a theory~$\Gamma$
    if~${\wv = \SM[\Gamma^\wv ]}$.
